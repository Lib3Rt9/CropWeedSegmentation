***Comment:

too much in "introduction on smart farming and precision agriculture";				  |
"too much application of uav in smart agriculture"						  |  comments about 
												  |   the presentation
too much time in intro about application of uav images and smart agriculture -> not main topic    |     (i have modified a bit 
												  |	     in the thesis)  

-> explain more about objective you want to do image segmentation on images. -> focus			
	-> not application of smart agriculture, why smart agriculture important

more info than just "RGB" channel, use only "RGB" -> explain tooo much details on channels other than RGB
	-> just take a few line explain about other details of the dataset made use
	-> focus just on RGB channel
		(*explain a lot of other channels in dataset -> confuse the reader)
	=> focus only in RGB channel, RGB image


In presentation, should focus more on methodology.

Don't need many references, trim, reduce some unnecessary.
